# We The Best Music App
A clone of Spotify using the Spotify Web API 
created as our final project for Phase 2 of 
FlatIron School to test our knowledge on React.

Upon first load of the web application, you
will be asked to authenticate your Spotify
account by logging in.

### Upon successful login
* You will be brought to the dashboard which will display 5 random genres as well as your own personal library on the left hand side of the application 
* A recently played section will appear below once you have played song
* On the center of the page will be up to 20 random playlist that, once clicked will display up to the first 100 songs in that playlist
* Once a song is clicked, it will be played using the Spotify Web API Player and the song name, artist name and album cover will be displayed in the recently played tab.
